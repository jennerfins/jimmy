  <p align="left"><a href="jimmy_home.html">This project is a living document comprised of artifacts, memories, and sense perceptions to honor and recreate the life of Hubert “Jimmy” Finley, my mother’s late father. The inability to know such a key figure in my family does not leave his space vacant in my memory. I am piecing together Jimmy’s puzzle by collecting public documents, letters, photos, and stories, absorbing the emotional energy of my mother and grandmother, and bearing witness to his extrasensory visits to my mother. <br />
    As a young man, he wrote daily to his mother. These numerous letters and envelopes have become a metaphor for my relationship with him and the dominant thematic image throughout this project. It is through these small packets of information and memory collected over time that I am able to fabricate my own and assemble an entity, a constellation, with whom I can connect. <br />
    The digital space that he now occupies behind this page is my visual manifestation of his apparition. </a></p>
